My name is Michael Pawlus

I have six years of experience in prospect research,management and analytics.

I am currently a Data Scientist at University of Southern California.

Most recently, I was Director of Prospect Development at The Trust for Public Land a national organization focused on land preservation and investing in city parks. 

Prior to joining TPL, I was the Assistant Director, Prospect Research and Development at Grand Valley State University in Grand Rapids, MI. Before this I established the prospect research framework, policy and procedures at St. Francis College in Brooklyn, NY. 

I have presented on my work at APRA-International, APRA-Canada, regional APRA conferences and local AFP conferences. I assisted with the creation of two online training courses and was programming chair on the APRA-Michigan Board as well as a member of the first ARC planning committee. I was also a contributor to the APRA-Canada book and was featured in an article in the Chronicle of Philanthropy.
